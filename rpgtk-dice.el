;;  DICE ROLLING BASICS
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------

;; The basics of a dice roll is a random number from a given range.
;; Note that if we give a 6-sided die to the random number, we will
;; end up with a range of 0 to 5, so we need to increase this value by
;; 1.

(defun rpgtk-dice-roll-die (sides)
  "Rolls a die of with SIDES."
  (interactive "nDice Type (sides): ")
  (1+ (random sides)))

;; Now that we have a `rpgtk--roll-die' function that rolls a single
;; die. How do we want multiple dice rolls. Perhaps the results should
;; be a list, so that we can easily sum them, but still have the
;; original results of each die roll.

(defun rpgtk-dice-roll (count sides)
  "Return a list of COUNT dice rolls where each die has SIDES."

      (setq value (cons (rpgtk-dice-roll-die sides) value)))))

;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; DICE MODIFICATIONS FUNCTIONS
;;
;; With a pool of dice, we want to have functions that emulate various
;; RPG games, for instance D&D takes a dice pool and then adds one or
;; more modifiers, where Blades in the Dark, rolls a pool of d6's and
;; takes the highest value.
;;
;; To make this easy, we create a mini-DSL

Use this to simulate special RPG-specific dice-roll
interpretations.

Where DICE-POOL is a list of numbers generated by rolling a
number of dice, and MODIFIERS is a sequence of modifications

For instance, to simulate a D&D style, like 2d8+4, we would:

    (rpgtk-dice-roll-mod (rpgtk-dice-roll 2 8)
                         :add 4
                         :sum)

Could return: ((1 7) (1 7 4) (12))

A Blades in the Dark game rolls a pool of d6, and takes the highest:

    (rpgtk-dice-roll-mod (rpgtk-dice-roll num-dice 6)
                         :max)

Which could return, if num-dice is 4:  ((1 3 5 2) (5))

Modifiers include:

    * :add    appends one or more numbers to the dice pool
    * :sum    adds all numbers in dice pool
    * :count  return number of dice in pool
    * :max    returns the highest number is pool
    * :min    returns the lowest number
    * :top    returns the highest number(s) based on parameter
              given, and if no number given, defaults to 1
    * :top    returns the lowest number(s) based on parameter
              given, and if no number given, defaults to 1
    * :filter only keeps numbers that pass a predicate lambda
    * :map    changes dice pool based on a given lamda expression"
