    ;; for something to be true, should bump us up around 75%:
    (should (= (rpgtk-odds-likelihood-offset 50 +2) 70))

    ;; And 50/50 odds with 2 levels of stabilty should do the opposite:
    (should (= (rpgtk-odds-likelihood-offset 50 -2) 30))

    ;; An unlikely question (around 37%) with 1 level of chaos, should
    ;; bump us close to the 50/50 realm:
    (should (= (rpgtk-odds-likelihood-offset 37 +1) 49))

    ;; But an unlikely question with 2 levels of chaos, should put the
    ;; question _likely_ (around 62%):
    (should (= (rpgtk-odds-likelihood-offset 37 +2) 61))

    ;; An absolutely sure thing (around 87-90% chance) with one level of
    ;; stability, should bring it down to just likely (around 62%):
    (should (= (rpgtk-odds-likelihood-offset 87 -1) 70))

    ;; But an absolutely sure things with more chaos, shouldn't affect
    ;; the outcome much:
    (should (= (rpgtk-odds-likelihood-offset 87 +1) 89))
