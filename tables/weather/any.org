[ Gentle / Fleeting / Persistent / Cool / Warm / Strong] rain
[ Gentle / Fleeting / Persistent / Cool / Warm ] drizzle
[ Distant / Limited / Threatening] thunder
[ Light / Dense] fog
[ Gentle / Fleeting / Persistent / Cool / Warm / Strong] wind
[ Gentle / Fleeting / Persistent / Cool / Warm / Strong] breeze
[ Fluffy / Few / Heavy / Blanket of] clouds
Clear with [ high / low] temperatures and [high / low] humidity
