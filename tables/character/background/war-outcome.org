Roll on Table: d12

|      1 | You were knocked out and left for dead. You woke up hours later with no recollection of the battle.                   |
|   2--3 | You were badly injured in the fight, and you still bear the awful scars of those wounds.                              |
|      4 | You ran away from the battle to save your life, but you still feel shame for your cowardice.                          |
|   5--7 | You suffered only minor injuries, and the wounds all healed without leaving scars.                                    |
|   8--9 | You survived the battle, but you suffer from terrible nightmares in which you relive the experience.                  |
| 10--11 | You escaped the battle unscathed, though many of your friends were injured or lost.                                   |
|     12 | You acquitted yourself well in battle and are remembered as a hero. You might have received a medal for your bravery. |
